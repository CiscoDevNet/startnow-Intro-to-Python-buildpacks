# StartNow - Intro to Python Cloud Native Buildpacks

=====================================
Using Buildpacks to simplify building docker containers

## Business Case

This repo walks through the basics of using a python buildpack to build and maintain your docker containers.

Building and maintaining a `Dockerfile` can be a pain. Most network engineers just want to get their app up and running without worrying about the things they don't need to know.

This is where Cloud Native Buildpacks come in because they remove the pain of building a container like:

- Finding the right images
- Security risks do to patching
- Time it takes to build a `Dockerfile`

They give you the ability to containerize your entire app in as little as 1 command. The buildpack will handle the version of python that will be used along with installing all of the dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
